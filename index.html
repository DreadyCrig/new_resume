		          		I'm Shawn and I like to create, develop, and code things.  I enjoy challenges, troubleshooting problems, fixing things that are broken and giving them new life.  I work with PHP, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and MySQL everyday and I offer my skills to others like a digital mercenary or a pixel perfectionist.  This resume is a work in progress which I built as a simple webpage to demonstrate basic abilities.
